<HTML><BODY><p>Today (the first of July, 2023, when this project was released) marks the 150th anniversary of the abolition of slavery in the Dutch colonies in the western hemisphere. Although the proclamation was already made on July first, 1863, slaves still had to wait 10 years before the actual emancipation. In commemoration of this, Surinamese people (both in Suriname and the Netherlands) celebrate "Keti Koti" -- the breaking of the chains in Sranan Tongo.</p>
<p>While I was looking for a relevant book for the occasion to offer at PGDP, I came across this work by the Dutch researcher Herman Jeremias Nieboer. Curiously enough, this doesn't cover slavery in the early industrial era (in the US and numerous European colonies), but dives into the mechanisms of slavery in various earlier ("primitive" or "savage" as they are called in this work) societies across the world.</p>
<p>Definitely not meant as an exercise in whataboutism, but still interesting to see how slavery functioned before the massive crime of modern slavery started.</p>
<p>Please note that the footnotes to this work are set in a continuous block. During the formatting rounds (and only then!), please place each footnote on a separate line, as if it is a paragraph on itself.</p></BODY></HTML>
